# PUBH8472_DV_Mapping
PUBH8472 Project 2 - Modeling DV Exposure in the Gambia

Files Included:

Gambia Data:

  The 2019 Gambia data downloaded from IPUMS-DHS is gambia_data/idhs_00032.csv
  Processing code and instructions are as included in PUBH8472_Proj2.Rmd
  Relevant variables are described at the bottom of this file.

Gambia Shapefiles:

    The 2019 Gambia shapefiles are located in gambia_data/shps
    Source: DHS Spatial Repository
    Processing code and instructions are included as part of PUBH8472_Proj2.R

Senegal Data:

  The 2019 Senegal data downloaded from The DHS Program (originally downloaded, now archived on IPUMS servers located at the University of Minnesota because Trump cronies might delete data, basically, as of now still available on DHS Program website, but new permissions aren't granted at the moment). 
  Located at senegal_data/SNIR8BFL.DTA.zip
  Warning this file is large! This is the full raw data file. It's not yet live on IPUMS-DHS, so there's no handpicked selection of variable available like for the Gambia. Processing steps are in PUBH8472_Proj2.R
  There is no full description of every single variable in this file, but variables relevant for the analysis are described below. 

Senegal Shapefiles:

  Located in senegal_data/senegal_boundaries_spa/shps
  These are technically the shapefiles from the 2019 SPA survey since the ones on the DHS Spatial Repository didn't match the regions in the region variable (v101) for Senegal 2019 DHS survey.
